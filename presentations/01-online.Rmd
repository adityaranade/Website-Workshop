## Departmental Website

The first thing you should do is 
[create your profile](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/people/jarad-niemi) on the Departmental Website
including

- picture
- education
- contact

You should be able to go to https://www.stat.iastate.edu/login and 
then to your [personal page](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/people/jarad-niemi). 


## ISU Website

ISU allows you to create your own site using 
[ISU Sites](https://sites.iastate.edu/).

Jarad advises against this because when you leave the university it will be 
gone.
I suggest you use an alternative that will exist permanently. 


## jekyll/github pages

Jarad's
[personal/professional website](https://www.jarad.me/) is hosted on
[github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and 
utilizes [jekyll-bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).
The [code is all available on github](https://github.com/jarad/jarad.github.com). 

Is this now the old-school way of doing it?


## blogdown/netlify

If you are just starting, 
Jarad's suggests you use 
[blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and host your site with 
[netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) 
following [these instructions](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/).


Jarad is creating a [website for the NCCC-170](https://nccc170.netlify.app/) 
group using this approach. 
The [code is available on github](https://github.com/NCCC-170/nccc170-website). 


## wowchemy

[Ricardo Batista's website](https://www.ricardobatista.com/) uses wowchemy. 
What does that even mean?



# Other topics

## Personalized domain names

You'll notice that our personal/professional websites have custom domain names

- [jarad.me](https://www.jarad.me/)
- [ricardobatista.com](https://www.ricardobatista.com/)

To buy a domain name, find a domain name registrar and buy a currently unused
domain name. 
[Domain names are pretty cheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/). 

Make sure to pay your registration every year!!!
