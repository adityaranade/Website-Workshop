# Welcome 

Welcome to the repository for the website workshop. The objective for this repo is to hold useful link and resources.

## Department website.

You can edit your personal departmental site on http://stat.iastate.edu/login/ and log in using your single sign-on credentials.

Next, click on “My Public Profile” in the top bar, and enter your information (including your current office number) in Snedecor. 

There is also a place to enter a bio, link your website, and upload a CV. 

Note, that you do not need to add a phone number, but if you do, please understand that it will be published on the website. 

Please upload a profile pic, and add any other information you would like to include.
