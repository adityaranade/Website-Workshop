# Welcome 

Welcome to the repository for the website workshop. The objective for this repo is to hold useful link and resources.



## Github
The first step is making sure you have your Git account up and running. 

If you need an intro to Github you can take a look at the following resources from 
* [Let’s Git started](https://happygitwithr.com/)

If you already have an account, and you just need to connect Github and Rstudio. 
* [Let’s get them talking](https://happygitwithr.com/connect-intro.html#connect-intro)

Need some help getting credentials into Rstudio?
 * [Take a look at gitcreeds library](https://gitcreds.r-lib.org/).
